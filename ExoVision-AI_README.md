## 🚀 Overview

**ExoVision-AI** is a machine learning–driven web application that automatically classifies celestial objects as **Confirmed Exoplanets** or **Planetary Candidates** using NASA's open **K2 Planets and Candidates Catalog**.  
Developed by a team of passionate space and AI enthusiasts for the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025**, this project bridges **data science** and **astrophysics** through real-time predictive modeling.

---

## 🌠 Key Highlights

-  **Intelligent ML Pipeline** – Preprocessing, feature engineering, and optimized Decision Tree + XGBoost models.  
-  **Interactive Web App (Flask)** – Upload datasets or manually enter parameters for instant classification.  
-  **Dynamic Visualizations** – Distribution charts, correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, and performance metrics.  
-  **End-to-End Reproducibility** – Ready-to-run environment with NASA data integration and trained models.  
-  **Hackathon-Optimized** – Lightweight, interpretable, and deployable in under 10 minutes.

## 🧩 Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Preprocessing**
  - Missing-value imputation (`SimpleImputer`)
  - Feature engineering (stellar & orbital parameters)
  - One-hot encoding for categorical features

- **Modeling Strategy**
  - **Parallel Model Development**: Team divided into two sub-teams for comparative analysis
  - **Team A**: Trained XGBoost and Decision Tree models (selected for final implementation)
  - **Team B**: Trained LightGBM model (used for performance benchmarking)
  - 5-Fold **Stratified Cross-Validation**

- **Model Selection**
  - XGBoost selected for superior performance and interpretability
  - Decision Tree maintained as fallback for transparency and comparison
  - Final ensemble approach leverages both models for robust predictions

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve visualizations

> Example average CV Accuracy: `~99.0%`

## 🖥️ Web Application

Built using **Flask**, the interface allows two modes:

1. **📤 CSV Upload:**  
   Upload new K2 data to automatically classify planetary candidates.

2. **🧮 Manual Input:**  
   Enter stellar and planetary parameters via form input to get instant predictions.

**Features include:**
- Real-time visualization of dataset distributions  
- Heatmaps and ROC curves for interpretability  
- Side-by-side comparison of XGBoost vs Decision Tree predictions
