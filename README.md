# ExoVision-AI 

AI-powered pipeline for **automatic exoplanet detection** using NASA‚Äôs **Kepler** open-source dataset.  
Built during the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025** by a team of 5 developers.

---

## Project Overview
Thousands of exoplanets have been identified from Kepler‚Äôs transit data, yet much of this work was done manually.  
**ExoVision-AI** uses modern Machine Learning to classify light curve data points as:

- ‚úÖ Confirmed Exoplanet  
- üü° Planetary Candidate  
- ‚ùå False Positive  

Our goal is to provide a reproducible model and a simple web interface where scientists and enthusiasts can upload new Kepler data and instantly receive classification results.

---

## Key Features
- **Kepler dataset integration** ‚Äì cleaned & preprocessed for ML.
- **Automated classification** ‚Äì using gradient boosting & deep learning models.
- **Interactive web interface** ‚Äì upload new light curves and view predictions.
- **Metrics dashboard** ‚Äì model accuracy, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
- **Hackathon-friendly** ‚Äì quick setup and reproducible environment.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** [NASA Exoplanet Archive ‚Äì Kepler Mission](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)  
- **Variables used:** Orbital period, transit duration, planetary radius, stellar parameters, etc.

---

## Model Architecture
- Preprocessing pipeline for missing values & scaling.
- Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost) experiments.
- Final ensemble model chosen for best ROC-AUC.
- Deployed behind a lightweight Python/Flask (or FastAPI) web server.
